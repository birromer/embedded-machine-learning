//32 bit word (unsigned) 	field 	Description/Content Hexadecimal numbers in C notation
//0 	                    magic number 	the value 0x2e736e64 (four ASCII characters ".snd")
//1 	                    data offset 	the offset to the data in bytes, must be divisible by 8. The minimum valid number is 24 (decimal), since this is the header length (six 32-bit words) with no space reserved for extra information (the annotation field). The minimum valid number with an annotation field present is 32 (decimal).
//2 	                    data size 	data size in bytes. If unknown, the value 0xffffffff should be used.
